## Important todos

* All sorting algorithms. What's a good default? What is used by Dart (and other progr. languages)? Faster than nlogn?

## Cheat sheet

Here, I summarize the core ideas, Dart syntax, data structures or algorithms that I keep forgetting.

### Sorting

You can find the default implementation of `List.sort`
in [`github.com/dart-lang`'s `sdk/lib/internal/sort.dart`](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/sdk/lib/internal/sort.dart)
.

It's the dual-pivot quicksort algorithm as presented in
[Vladimir Yaroslavskiy's paper](https://codeblab.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/DualPivotQuicksort.pdf).
It uses two pivot elements (so partitions to three parts).

The dual pivot quicksort algorithm reduces the average number of swaps
by [20%](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9jj5z/vladimir_yaroslavskiys_dualpivot_quicksort/).
The average number of comparisons stays the same.

On average, it takes $O(n \log n)$ comparisons, in the worst case $O(n^2)$.

For lists with a length less than 32, Dart uses [insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort), $O(n^2)
$.

### Queue

A `Queue` is a collection that can be manipulated at both ends.

Its implementers, `DoubleLinkedQueue` and `ListQueue`, are efficient for queue or stack usage.

```dart
// Queue, DoubleLinkedQueue, ListQueue
import 'dart:collection';
```

The `DoubleLinkedQueue` is an implementation of the `Queue` based on a double-linked list.
It allows **constant time add, remove-at-ends and peek operations**.

```dart

final doubleLinkedQueue = DoubleLinkedQueue<int>();
```

The `ListQueue` is a list based `Queue`.
It keeps a cyclic buffer of elements, and grows to a larger buffer when it fills up.
This guarantees **constant time peek and remove operations, and amortized constant time add operations**.

```dart

final initialCapacity = 16; // Default init capacity is 8.
final listQueue = ListQueue<int>(initialCapacity);
```

| | add (to ends) | remove (at ends) | peek |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `DoubleLinkedQueue` | $O(1)$ | $O(1)$ | $O(1)$ |
| `ListQueue`  | amortized $O(1)$ | $O(1)$ | $O(1)$ |

**Minimalist extensions for stacks and queues**.

Sometimes, I find that the traditional queue operations come easier, especially if I am under stress and I feel
pressured to be fast and clear while at an interview.

For this reason, I prefer to add the "minimalist" queue and stack static extension methods on the `Queue`.

```dart
extension MinimalistQueue<E> on Queue<E> {
  void enqueue(E value) => addLast(value);

  E dequeue() => removeFirst(); // throws StateError if empty!
  E? peek() => firstOrNull; // For most problems, peek is not needed.
}
```

```dart
extension MinimalistStack<E> on Queue<E> {
  void push(E value) => addLast(value);

  E pop() => removeLast(); // throws StateError if empty!
  E? peek() => lastOrNull; // For most problems, peek is not needed.
}
```

### Regex

```dart
// Assumes string's of length 1
bool get isAlphaNumericChar => RegExp(r'^[\w\d]$').hasMatch(this);
// or RegExp(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9]$')
```

### ASCII code units

For day-to-day work, knowing and remembering the ASCII code units of different characters is completely useless.

However, in many coding challenges, it can come in handy.

|           |   starts |      ends | count |
|-----------|---------:|----------:|------:|
| numbers   | 48 (`0`) |  57 (`9`) |    10 |
| uppercase | 65 (`A`) |  90 (`Z`) |    26 |
| lowercase | 97 (`a`) | 122 (`z`) |    26 |

For example, if you know that the input is ASCII-only, you can determine very easily
whether a character is alphanumeric using code units.

```dart
// Assumes string's of length 1
bool get isAlphaNumericChar {
  final codeUnit = codeUnitAt(0);
  final isNumber = 48 <= codeUnit && codeUnit <= 57;
  final isUpperCase = 65 <= codeUnit && codeUnit <= 90;
  final isLowerCase = 97 <= codeUnit && codeUnit <= 122;
  return isNumber || isLowerCase || isUpperCase;
}
```

In this example, let's say we know about the input string that it only contains lowercase letters (English alphabet).
If we need to store, for example, a counter for each letter in a list, we can write this static extension getter
to convert from strings to the indices for the list.

```dart
extension CharToIndex on String {
  // Assumes only lowercase and length == 1 
  int get charIndex => codeUnitAt(0) - 97;
}
```

#### Tree traversal

* Preorder: root, left, right
* Post order: left, right, root
* Inorder: left, root, right

#### Binary search

You need to be able to write a binary search in a minute, you don't have 10 minutes to think about edge cases.

TODO: Check card: https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/binary-search/

#### Reverse linked list

Must know it well!

### Mix

```dart
import 'dart:math';
final maxValue = max(a, b);
// or
import 'dart:math' as math;
final maxValue = math.max(a, b);
```

```dart
import 'package:collection/collection.dart';

/// Equality on lists.
///
/// Two lists are equal if they have the same length and their elements
/// at each index are equal.
bool match(List<int> a, List<int> b) => const ListEquality().equals(a, b);
```

```dart
// part of dart core

// Check whether two references are to the same object.
external bool identical(Object? a, Object? b);
```

## Disclaimers

### Coding conventions

I do not always follow the official Dart style guide
or rules that are in most popular linting libraries enabled.

You can find below the list of rules that I do not follow with a reason as to why that is.

* `curly_braces_in_flow_control_structures`: I don't want to "spend" three lines just to write a simple `while`, `if`, `for`.
* `avoid_multiple_declarations_per_line`: sometimes two declarations just belong together, and at interviews, you really don't have enough time to declare everything in a new line.

### Test quality

I didn't spend time writing the perfect test description for my tests.
I made sure that I have enough tests to spot any potential mistakes and that I add the examples from LeetCode.

This doesn't mean that in your day job, you should write the tests like I did in this repository,
it just means that I wanted to focus on solving the problem correctly.

Unfortunately, LeetCode doesn't work with Dart, if you want to change that, upvote this issue.
LeetCode doesn't do it for me for Dart).

### Solution descriptions

The solution descriptions are mostly for myself. For cases, where the challenge was very easy for me, I didn't spend
much effort on describing the solution.

## Challenges

Below you can find a list of challenges that I already solved.

Following [Neetcode's advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVvr3ZjtjI8), I summarize each challenge's core concepts
and different ways to solve the challenges with its pros and cons.

<details>
<summary><b>Two Sum</b> üè∑ <i>array</i></summary>

> [Solution](./test/two_sum_test.dart)
> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

> Exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.
> Return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

We need to return the indices.
Create a map where _the key is the number value_ and _the value is its index_.

Iterate over numbers: store visited numbers and their indices in the map.

As you iterate, check whether current number has a _complement_ in the map that adds up to target.
If it does, return the indices.
If it doesn't, add number to the map.

**Complexity analysis**: $n$ is the number of elements in the list.
* **Time complexity**: $O(n)$, as you might iterate over the whole list.
* **Space complexity**: $O(n)$, as you might need to store almost all elements and their indices in the map.

Other solutions:

* **Brute force**: double loop, return when the two numbers add up to the target.
  * **Time complexity**: $O(n^2)$, for each of $n$ elements, we try to find its complement by looping through the rest of the list. 
  * **Space complexity**: $O(1)$, no extra space that depends on the input size is necessary.
* [Sort list](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted) first, then on a sorted list, find values with two pointers (from start and end).
  * **Time complexity**: $O(n \log n)$, because sort $O(n \log n)$ + two pointers $O(n)$.
  * **Space complexity**: $O(n)$, sort and two-pointers would be possible with $O(1)$, but we need to store original indices $O(n)$.
  * This solution, as the list is not already sorted and we need to return the original indices, is fairly complicated, and doesn't perform too well (neither in space nor time complexity).

<summary><b>Valid Parentheses</b> üè∑ <i>stack</i></summary>

> [Solution](./test/valid_parentheses_test.dart)
> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)

> input string consists of parentheses/brackets only `()[]{}`

Push opening parenthesis/bracket to a stack.
Pop off when closing, and make sure they are matching.
Don't forget to check at the end if the stack is empty.
Remember to pop off only if stack is not empty (or use peek).

**Complexity analysis**: $n$ is the length of the input string.
* **Time complexity**: $O(n)$, as you iterate over the whole input string, and potentially adding half of them to a stack. Pushing and popping on a stack can be a $O(1)$ operation if the stack is efficient.
* **Space complexity**: $O(n)$, we need a stack that might contain $n$ elements.

[Solution variant](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/discuss/500491/Rust-0ms), you could immediately push the closing parenthesis onto the stack, it actually ends up looking pretty nice.

<summary><b>Merge Two Sorted Lists</b> üè∑ <i>linked list</i></summary>

> [Solution](./test/merge_two_sorted_lists_test.dart)
> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

_Trick: pre-head pointer significantly simplifies the iterative algorithm._

While both lists are not empty, pick one off the lists and add to the results.
Move pointer.
Do not forget to add the remaining items of the longer list to the list.
Return the pre-head's next as result.

Consider empty nodes. Do not assume the two lists are of equal length.

**Complexity analysis**, $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of the input linked lists:
* **Time complexity**: $O(n+m)$ (linear with total length), because we simply iterate over both lists and picking the correct.
* **Space complexity**: $O(1)$, only need a couple of variables, constant space, and the returned list consists of nodes already created before the solution algorithm ran.

Alternative solutions:
* Recursive solution. Basically the same, just with different space complexity due to the stack.

<summary><b>Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock</b> üè∑ <i>array</i></summary>

> [Solution](./test/best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock_test.dart)
> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

_Clarify at the interview_:
* What is the input, `int` vs `num` vs `double`? In this case, we work with `int`.
* Can it be negative/positive? It doesn't affect the algorithm.
* What should the solution return if it is impossible to achieve any profit? Return 0 if no profit possible.

Keep track of min price "so far".
Current profit is price minus the min price so far.
Update max profit if current profit greater.
Handle negative profit edge case (must return 0).

**Complexity analysis**, $n$ is the length of the list:
* **Time complexity**: $O(n)$, as you iterate over the whole list in a single pass.
* **Space complexity**: $O(1)$, because you only need two variables holding integers.

Alternative solutions:
* brute force: double loop, calculate profit for each possible pair.
  * **Time complexity**: $O(n^2)$, for each number, sweep the rest of the list.
  * **Space complexity**: $O(1)$.

<details>
<summary><b>Valid Palindrome</b> üè∑ <i>string</i></summary>

> [Solution](./test/valid_palindrome_test.dart)
> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)

Start with two pointers at each end of the string.
If a letter is not alphanumeric, move pointer to next alphanumeric.
Whenever the two pointers contain alphanumeric chars, compare.
If the values for the two pointers don't match, return "not a palindrome".

**Complexity analysis**, $n$ is the length of the string:
* **Time complexity**: $O(n)$, as we traverse over each character at most once.
* **Space complexity**: $O(1)$, because you only need two variables holding integers.

Alternative solutions:

* filter and transform invalid characters (keep only alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase)
  (`split`+`where`+`map`+`join`).
  Then, check if palindrome: either two pointers, or reverse the string and compare against filtered values. TODO: I could actually implement this one day.

<summary><b>Invert Binary Tree</b> üè∑ <i>binary tree</i></summary>

> [Solution](./test/invert_binary_tree_test.dart)
> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)

> The inverse of a tree with root $R$, and subtrees $r$ and $l$, is a tree with root $R$, whose
> right subtree is the inverse of $l$, and whose left subtree is the inverse of $r$.

Invert tree recursively. Swap children, then invert left and right subtrees. Handle null case.

Both pre-order and post-order traversal give the right answer.

**Complexity analysis**, $n$ is the number of the nodes in the tree:
* **Time complexity**: $O(n)$, we visit each node once.
* **Space complexity**: $O(n)$, the recursion stack will be as high as the tree, which in the worst case is equal to the number of nodes.

TODO: Solve iteratively, both post and preorder.

<summary><b>Valid Anagram</b> üè∑ <i>string</i></summary>

> [Solution](./test/valid_anagram_test.dart)
> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)

Return early if lengths don't match. Create frequency counter. Check if frequencies match.

Complexity.
n is the length of the strings.
Time O(n) as we need to iterate over the both strings entirely to create the frequency table.
Space O(1) size stays constant no matter how large n is (even for unicode).

Worth creating a helper class `Frequency` that can be created from a string and then compared against another freq.

Follow up: unicode? Change how frequencies are stored from fixed length list to hash map.
To fit all potential unicode characters in a list, the list would have to contain 1M+ elements.
That's wasteful if the strings are short (and anything less than a million characters counts as short in this case).

Solutions:

* TC O(n^3). Three loops: two for moving the indices, one for calculating the sum
* TC O(n^2). One for moving the start index, the other one for the end index and continuously updating the sum in the
  line. Biggest sum wins in the end.
* TC O(n). Kadane (greedy?). Iterate over items. Keep track of max and "current max". When single item is better than

> [Solution](./test/squares_of_a_sorted_array_test.dart)

Must consider possible negative numbers!

Very brute force solution (does not mutate input): Map square (TC: O(n), SC: O(n)), sort (TC: O(n log n), SC: O(1)).

Brute force solution (mutates input, no extra space at all): Square each number in place (TC: O(n), SC: O(1)), sort the
list (TC: O(n log n), SC: O(1)).

Two-pointer solution: from one of the two ends of the list will come the next biggest square (postive, negative numbers)
.
Move two pointers, and the biggest square will be added to a list. You can create a fixed size list beforehand, in this
case, the list will be filled from the end (largest) to the start (smallest).

* Add k elements into a max heap. After the kth, every time you add something into the heap, pop off the largest value.
  At the end, add remaining items to the result (either as list or iterable).

<summary><b>Diameter of a Binary Tree</b> üè∑ <i>binary tree</i></summary>

> [Solution](./test/diameter_of_a_binary_tree_test.dart)
> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)

Calculate height for each node: height = max(left, right) + 1.
Calculate diameter for each node: diameter = leftHeight + rightHeight.
While calculating the heights and diameters, update "max diameter".

Do it recursively, and iteratively.

Iterative postorder traversal is easy with two stack (though also possible with one), and you keep track of heights in
map of nodes to heights.

<summary><b>Reverse Bits</b> üè∑ <i>binary</i></summary>

> [Solution](./test/reverse_bits_test.dart)
> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits)

Get rightmost bit of the value and add it to the result.
Then shift the input value to the right and shift the result to the left.

Reminder: know your [bitwise operators](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dart_programming/dart_programming_operators.htm):
AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left and right shifts.

According to [Numbers in Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/numbers):

> Depending on the platform, those numeric types (`int` and `double`) have different, hidden implementations.
> In particular, Dart has two very different types of targets it compiles to:
> **native** (most often, a 64-bit mobile or desktop processor)
> and **web** (JavaScript as the primary execution engine).

Keep in mind that on JavaScript, that "JavaScript converts numbers into 32 bits before the implementation of bitwise
operators"
which can lead to [surprising behavior](https://stackoverflow.com/a/73471501/4541492).

<summary><b>Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation</b> üè∑ <i>stack</i></summary>

> [Solution](./test/evaluate_reverse_polish_notation_test.dart)
> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/)

Iterate over input.
If it's a number, add to stack.
If it's an operation, perform operation on top 2 items in the stack, and push result back to stack.

**Complexity analysis**.
$n$ is the length of the input list.
**Time complexity**: $O(n)$, as you iterate over the whole list in a single pass. Pushing to and popping off the stack
is $O(1)$.
**Space complexity**: $O(n)$, as the supporting stack can never be more than half the length of the input.

<summary><b>Sort Colors</b> üè∑ <i>array</i></summary>

> [Solution](./test/sort_colors_test.dart)
> [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

If we could use Dart's built-in sorting algorithm, it's a one-liner: dual pivot quicksort $O(n \log n)$ average case,
$O(n^2)$ worst case.

We know that the possible values can only be 0, 1, 2, therefore,
we can use [counting sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort).

**Complexity analysis**.
$n$ is the length of the input list.
**Time complexity**: $O(n)$, as you iterate over the whole list first to count, then to overwrite.
**Space complexity**: $O(1)$, as we only need three supporting counter variables.

TODO: There is another one-pass solution I didn't check. Dutch flag.
